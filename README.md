# My Markdown Preview

A **Markdown Preview Generator** is a simple web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This tool allows users to write and preview Markdown syntax in real-time. It converts Markdown input into formatted HTML, helping users see how their Markdown will look once rendered.
